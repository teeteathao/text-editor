# PWA: Text Editor

## Description

A text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.


## User Story

SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
